# Responsive-Profile
# Introduction
I built a responsive portfolio website by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Elements included
1.Essential Web Page Sections: Include a landing page, about section, project showcase, and contact information.

2.Responsive Design Elements: I ensured that my portfolio is functional on mobile and desktop devices.

3.Portfolio Content: I displayed a selection of projects.

4.Contact Methods: I had to include easy ways for potential employers or collaborators to contact me.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
Proficiency in HTML - I believe I can create a well-structured HTML document which saves a bit of time and this helps me to spend more time on CSS and Javascript.

# Challenges Faced
CSS Styling Elements: I feel this area I was lacking in because of how many problems I would encounter and after solving the first issue there would be a new one.

# Areas for Improvement 
I would like to improve my CSS skills

# Overall Learning Experience
With this project I got an idea of what my completed portfolio will look like and I got to learn about media queries, flexible layouts, and viewport settings to create a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
